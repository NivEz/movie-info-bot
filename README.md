# Movies & shows information bot (Notflix)

#### Get information about movies and shows (rate for example) before you decide to watch them

This project is a telegram bot written with [`Telenode`](https://github.com/NivEz/telenode).

It supports a caching layer, fully deployed on a kubernetes cluster and has a CI/CD pipeline.

You simply have to type the show / movie you want to watch and the bot will respond with some information about it.
